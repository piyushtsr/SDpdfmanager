(Disclaimer: This app has many bugs in responsiveness, and some minor bugs, also for now other users cannot comment as the routes are protected.

Similarly, for the case of sending mail, proper research on how to give an anonymous user to have access, needs to be done yet)

- allwing authenticated user to upload pdf of their choice
- allowing user to add comment to an particular pdf
- share the pdf to another user(on progress...)
